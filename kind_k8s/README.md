# Kind Lab

KinD is a tool that enables developers to run Kubernetes clusters locally using Docker containers as nodes. It provides a robust and efficient way to manage Kubernetes clusters for development, testing, and CI/CD workflows. KinD is simple to use, lightweight, and replicates the production environment to a large extent, allowing developers to easily spot potential issues before deployment.

- Docker: Ensure you have Docker running on your machine. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- kubectl: This is a command-line tool that allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.

## Topics Covered

In this lab, you will learn about:

1. Installing KinD on your local machine.
2. Creating a local Kubernetes cluster using KinD.
3. Interacting with your KinD Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.
